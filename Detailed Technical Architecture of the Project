Project Name: ATOWA Conseil - Intelligent Agricultural Advisor
Overview: ATOWA Conseil is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for offline use, targeting African farmers with weather updates, AI-driven advice, and image-based crop analysis. The architecture ensures scalability, offline functionality, and accessibility.Components:Frontend:Technology: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla or Framework like React).Features: Responsive design, offline caching via Service Workers, user interface for weather display, advice input, and image upload.Tools: Built with Lovable (https://lovable.dev) for rapid prototyping, hosted via a static file server.Prototype: https://atowa-agri-advisor-ai.lovable.app.Backend:Technology: Serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda or Vercel) or a lightweight Node.js server.APIs:Weather API: OpenWeatherMap (RESTful, requires API key) for real-time data.AI Advice: Custom ML model (e.g., TensorFlow.js) for offline advice generation, trained on agricultural data.Image Analysis: Google Vision API or TensorFlow.js for offline image processing (crop health detection).Data Storage: LocalStorage for offline data, synced with a cloud database (e.g., Firebase) when online.Offline Support:Service Worker: Caches static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) and API responses for offline access.IndexedDB: Stores user inputs and analysis results locally.Security:HTTPS enforcement for data privacy.API key encryption and rate limiting.Scalability:CDN (e.g., Cloudflare) for global delivery.Future integration with AtowaFi will require blockchain nodes
Future Enhancements (AtowaFi):Expand backend with a microservice for financial transactions. And also blockchain int√©gration for tokenization .
This architecture supports Phase 1 (ATOWA Conseil) with a roadmap for Phase 2 (AtowaFi), requiring $10,000-$15,000 for API integration and pilot scaling.
