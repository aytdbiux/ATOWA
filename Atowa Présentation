ATOWA Conseil is a groundbreaking Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to transform agriculture for African farmers, starting in Francophone regions like Côte d’Ivoire. This offline-capable platform tackles the lack of accessible tools by delivering real-time weather updates, AI-driven farming advice, and image-based crop analysis, aiming to boost yields by up to 20%. The live prototype, accessible at https://atowa-agri-advisor-ai.lovable.app, is in Phase 1, built by solopreneur Alan Emmanuel using Lovable and hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/aytdbiux/ATOWA/tree/main). The freemium business model offers free basic access with a $2/month premium for advanced features, targeting 1,000 users in Phase 1 and 10,000 in Phase 2, with projected revenues of $10,000. Future plans include AtowaFi, an extension for financial services like payments and loans, enhancing scalability. ATOWA seeks $5,000-$15,000 to finalize APIs, launch a pilot, and develop AtowaFi. SWOT analysis reveals strengths (innovative offline tech), weaknesses (solo team), opportunities (untapped market), and threats (competition). With a clear roadmap—Q3 2025 for the pilot, Q1 2026 for expansion—and strategic partnerships, ATOWA aims to revolutionize sustainable farming in Africa, supported by open-source development and community engagement.
